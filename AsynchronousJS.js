//Asynchronous simply means that we don't have it right now,
//When we build modern websites, we don't have all the data initially. We have our HTML page, CSS page, and some JS, But as the page is being loaded, we also have to make a request may be to a 
//database. May be we need to make a request across the web to fetch some third party API
//All of these will require asynchronous code because it's information we don't have yet
//In oreder to get the info we are saying to JS, can you find this for me, and when you are done with it, come back and give me that information
//JS has no idea what the world wide web or internet is, it's single threaded, It's a programming language
//On the other hand, the web browser or node JS allows us ti use async or asynchronous code so we can iteract with things outside the world of JS

//Asynchronous functions are functions that we can execute later
