//Object oriented programming and Functional programming, Both are called programming paradigms

//OOP and FP are paradigms that allows us to organize code in such a way that is easy to reason about. 


//By using OOP and FP we can make our code
//1.Clear and Understandable
//2.Easy to understand: as our app grows, as no of devs working in a projects grow , it's easier to extend these programming paradigms.
//3.Easy to maintain
//Memory efficient
//DRY: Do not Repeat Yourself

//In all programs there two primary components
//The data and the behaviour, to deal with them we had languages like Java and Scheme.

//OOP says bringing together data and it's behaviour in a single location, Called an object and containing all that in a boxmakes it easier to understand how our programs work

//FP says that data and behaviour are distnictly different things and should be kept separate for clarity. So instead of having one giant box to describe everything , we have multiple boxes.

//OOP is like building a robot. where we have different kinds of components like head, arm, chest, antena  and we build those together

//FP says just give me a data and I'll act upon that data through functions. And I will return something new from the data that you gave me.

//The two pillars Closures and Prototypes finally allows us to learn about these topics

//Closures , were a big part of functions and without closures we wouldn't be able to do the things that we are gooing to do for FP

//Without prototypes we wouldn't be able to do the things that we are going to do in OOP
