//There are many ways that we can introduce static typing in JS
//FLOW, elm , 
//reasonML - By facebook
//Typescript: by microsoft

//Reason is based on a programming language like ocammel
//Flow: Flow is able to add types to our JS by writing some code that works with flo and then putting it thriugh a compiler such as Babel compiler which spits out JS
//Babel takes es6 code or es8 code and changes it into es5 code so that all browsers can understand it, flow is a static type checker, Which means writing something on top of our files

// @flow It will check the types

//TypeScript:
//Typescript is a superset of JS, It adds functionality on top of JS. TS just adds a few extra features on top of JS, but it also has it's own compiler,
//(A compiler is a machine that simply takes an input of some piece of code and outputs a different piece of code.)


//The difference between reasonML and Ts is reason is a completely separate language from JS on it's own, 

//TS tries to mimic JS and grow with JS, as it is superset of JS, but reason ML is a whole different thing on it's own

//Demand of TS is more than the other tools

//When to use typescript:
//Your project runs bigger bigger,
