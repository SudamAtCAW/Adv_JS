//Javascript is a single threaded programming language
//Being single threaded means only one set of instructions at a time
//and not multiple instructions at once
//Call stack only allows running one function at a time
//We are never running functions in parallel

//That is why javascript is synchronous.That is one at a time in 
//order that it appears only one thing can happen at the time


//With single threaded and synchronous code we can not do any thing 
//until the current running program gets excuted and removed from call syack

alert('hi')

//this line of code won't allow you to take any action until you click on ok 

//Most of the time we won't be just using javascript  engine which is syncronous 
//we need to introduce the idea of asynchoronus code
//we have some thing called javascript runtime.
