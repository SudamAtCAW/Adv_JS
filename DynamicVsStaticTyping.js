//JS is the dominant language on the web and with the introduction of things like nide.js , we can JS out side of web, Perhaps in the backend server as well. 
//JS is Dynamically typed. A dynamically typed language allows us to not to have to say what type of variable this variable a is going to be
var a = 100

//Statically Types, We have to declare the variable explicitily befor using them
//int a ;
//a= 100;

//Dynamically typed language are not bound to a particular type, JS is smart enoungh to assign which type to a variable comparing the value.
//In Dymically typed language type checking is done during runtime

//While the user is actually browsing through the website JS is running and being compiled in the background.

//The good thing about a statically typed language is we get documentation. 

// function(a:number, b:number){
//     return a+b
// }

//In the above case user will get to know what type of parameters it needs to pass for the function, That is why Statically typed laguages are self documented

//IN IDEs for stattically typed languages by using plugIns we can get to know the errors even before running the code
//In statically typed language we will get less bugs in production.  

//Statically typed language have slower developement process

//With Dynamically typed languages like JS we spend less time debugging syntax and most of your time is spent purely on logic and errors which as a developer are lot more interesting.

//Static Types usually prevent bugs and help keep errors from happening

//Dynamic typing allows you to be more flexible and write software faster

//Type Script:
//It allows us to make JS to behave like a statically typed language. It adds types to JS. Makes JS extra save
